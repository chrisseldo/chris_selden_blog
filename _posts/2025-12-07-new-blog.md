There is something about the end of a year that motivates me to create a new blog. The setup is always the same too: 
- Jekyll setup
- GitHub pages
- Update DNS
- Deploy

I'm always inspired by the prolific nature of blogs like Marginal Revolution where it's not much writing per se, but a lot of interesting tid bits that Tyler Cowen reads throughout the week. I don't think I'll ever come near his level of production, but I'd like to move closer to it. 

Some areas I'll look to cover more this coming year: 
- tech / ai (ha)
- music
- coffee
- home ownership
- family life
